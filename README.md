PoT java implementation

This is a source code used in the following conference paper [1].
It includes the pooled time series (PoT) representation framework as well as basic per-frame descriptor extractions including histogram of optical flows (HOF) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG).
For more detailed information on the approach, please check the paper.
